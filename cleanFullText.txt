rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned but not her wedding ring lestrade looks shocked as sherlock continues in the background state of her marriage right there sherlock is squatting down beneath the womans body and he continues to explain the inside of the ring is shinier than the outside that means its regularly removed the only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger sherlock its not for work look at her nails sherlock looks down a view of jennifer wilsons hand with pink nail polish sherlock continues she doesnt work with her hands john looks at sherlock in shock as sherlock gets up and continues so what or rather whom does she remove her rings for sherlock clearly not one lover shed never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time so more

the sound of a telephone ringing is heard and john stops walking john turns to where the sound is coming from it is from a public telephone in a red booth he looks at it for a few seconds john looks down at his watch shakes his head and continues down the road a view of the telephone booth it stops ringing as john starts walking away not long afterwards john is walking down the main road he tries to hail a passing taxi john yells out taxi taxi the taxi passes him by in chicken cottage the fast food restaurant outside which john is stand the payphone on the wall begins to ring john turns and looks as one of the serving staff walks over to it but as he reaches for the phone it stops john stares at the phone from the outside for a moment then resumes walking john is walking on down the road and shortly afterwards approaches another public telephone box the phone inside starts to ring john stops mystified by this he looks left and right to see if anyone else is going to pick up john reaches for the telephone booth door and goes into the telephone box john lifts the phone puts it to his ear and says hello a mans voice speaks down on the phone the man says there is a security camera on the building to your left do you see it john does not turn his head he frowns john whos this there is no answer john asks again whos speaking cameras point of view of john in the phone box the man says do you see the camera doctor watson the camera zooms in john is looking through the window of the phone box a shot of the cctv camera high up on the wall of a nearby building john replies yeah i see it the man says watch the camera which was pointing directly at the phone box now swivels away john is no longer visible through the camera the screen is split into four supposedly four cameras brixton 053 brixton 002 brixton 051 brixton 047 that show what is going on on the street brixton 051 the camera that has just swivelled now shows a close up of the road nothing else is visible brixton 053 and brixton 047 are still showing john in the phone booth at different angles the man says theres another camera on the building opposite to you john looks around to find it a shot of the other cctv camera the mans voice continues do you see it john does not answer but he is looking in the cameras direction the camera immediately swivels away the man and finally at the top of the buliding on your right john turns his head to find the camera cameras point of view of john staring up into the third camera johns viewpoint of the camera as it turns away the screen is split into four now camera brixton 053 051 and 047 which were initially trained on the phone boxs direction are showing nothing john asks into the phone how are you doing this the mans voice says get into the car doctor watson a black car pulls up at the kerbside near the phone john watches it pull up the man continues i would make some sort of threat but im sure your situation is quite clear to you the male driver gets out and opens the rear car door the phone goes dead john puts the phone down and looks thoughtful for a moment then turns to leave the phone box
a few moments later john is sitting in the back seat of the car as it pulls away and drives off john is on the right seat right behind the driver an attractive young woman is sitting beside john her eyes fixed on her blackberry while she types on it she is ignoring him john turns toward her and says hello the woman smiles brightly at him for a moment and says hi before returning her gaze to her phone john awkwardly stays seated john turns to the woman and asks whats your name then the woman without looking up from her phone replies er anthea john asks anthea is that your real name anthea smiles turns toward john and says no john nods then twists to look out of the rear window briefly before turning back again john says im john while looking straight ahead anthea still with eyes locked on her phone replies yes i know john surprised looks at anthea for a moment then turns back john looks straight at the road and asks any point in asking where i am going anthea turns and smiles briefly at him and says none at all then looks back at her phone again she continues john john turns to look out his window on the right and says okay some time later the car pulls into an almostempty warehouse

john pauses then deliberately shifts his feet under him as if digging in he raises his left hand bending it at the elbow and stands still he wants the man to come to him to see his hand unperturbed by johns beligerence the man strolls forward hooking the handle of the umbrella over his arm as he reaches for johns hand the man reaches for johns hand john instantly pulls his hand back a little and says tensely dont the man lowers his head and raises his eyebrows at john with a small smile john stares at the man for a moment john very reluctantly lowers his hand holding it out flat with the palm down the man takes it in both of his own hands the man examines johns hand closely then states remarkable john snatches his hand away and asks what is the man turns and while walking a few paces away says most people blunder round this city and all they see are streets and shops and cars john is staring at the man the man stops walking and continues when you walk with sherlock holmes you see the battlefield john is looking at the man with a serious look the whole time the man turns toward john again and asks youve seen it already havent you john asks whats wrong with my hand the man says you have an intermittent tremor in the man continues your left hand john nods in agreement the man your therapist thinks its posttraumatic the man continues stress disorder she thinks youre haunted by memories of your military service john almost flinches as the man accurately fires off these facts at him his gaze is fixed ahead of him and a muscle in his cheek twitches repeatedly john angry and distressed asks who the hell are you the man does not answer john asks how do you know that the man ignores johns questions and says fire her shes got it the wrong way around the man continues youre under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady johns eyes flicker downwards before returning to stare ahead of himself his face set and struggling to hold back his anger the man youre not haunted by the war doctor watson you miss it the man leans closer to john reluctantly johns eyes rise up to meet his the man whispers welcome back the man turns to walk away john looks straight ahead and looks angry but defeated the man is walking away toward johns right while casually twirling his umbrella as he goes just then john receives another text message alert john continues to look straight ahead the man says while walking away time to choose a side doctor watson john turns his head toward the man and glances at him for a moment then looks straight ahead once again behind john the car door opens anthea gets out and walks a few paces towards john her attention still fixed on the blackberry held in front of her in both hands
john half turns toward anthea at the sound of her footsteps anthea says im to take you home john stops and takes out his phone from his left pocket to look at the new message it reads could be dangerous sh john puts the phone back in his left pocket john holds out his left hand in front of him and studies the lack of tremor coming from it he smiles wryly anthea asks address john turns toward her john replies er baker street john starts walking toward anthea and specifies two two one b baker street john walks toward the car while saying but i need to stop off somewhere first later john opens the door to his bedsit walks in switches on the light and closes the door behind him
john walks toward his desk looking around to his right john opens his desk drawer john takes out his pistol from the drawer john checks the clip of the gun john tucks the gun into the back of his waistband of his jeans and turns to leave again

sherlock does not respond and remains on the sofa with his eyes closed john says you asked me to come im assuming its important sherlock doesnt respond instantly after a couple of seconds his eyes snap open he doesnt bother turning his head to look at john and asks oh yeah of course can i borrow your phone john asks my phone sherlock still with his hands together replies dont wanna use mine always a chance that the number will be recognised its on the website john turns his head toward the door and says mrs hudsons got a phone sherlock yeah shes downstairs i tried shouting but she didnt hear john beginning to get angry says i was on the other side of london sherlock says calmly there was no hurry john glares at sherlock and sighs john reaches into his pocket while staring at sherlock lying down peacefully john holds the phone out to sherlock and says here without opening his eyes sherlock holds out his right hand palm up john slaps the phone into his hand john glowers at him for a moment and turns and walks a few paces away sherlock has lifted his arm and put his hands together again so that he now has the phone between his palms john asks so whats this about the case sherlock says softly her case john turns around and asks her case he is standing in front of the fireplace sherlock opens his eyes and says her suitcase yes obviously the murderer took her suitcase first big mistake john okay he took her case so sherlock say quietly as if to himself its no use theres no other way well have to risk it john is standing looking at sherlock sherlock imperiously holds out the phone to john without looking at him and orders on my desk theres a number i want you to send a text john halfsmiles in disbelief john says with a restrained angry voice you brought me here to send a text sherlock oblivious to his anger replies text yes the number on my desk sherlock continues to hold the phone out to john john continues to glower at him and stretches his neck john stomps across the room and snatches the phone from sherlocks hand sherlock refolds his hands under his chin and closes his eyes and breathes out a sigh instead of walking to the table john walks over to the window and looks out of it into the streets below sherlock opens his eyes and tilts his head slightly toward johns direction and asks whats wrong
john replies while looking out of the window just met a friend of yours sherlock frowns in confusion and asks a friend john replies an enemy sherlock unfazed by johns answer visibly relaxes and asks oh which one john pauses for a moment surprised by sherlocks reaction john says your archenemy according to him he turns toward sherlock and asks do people have archenemies sherlock looks towards john narrowing his eyes suspiciously sherlock asks did he offer you money to spy on me john looks at sherlock and says yes sherlock asks did you take it john says no sherlock looks toward john and says pity we could have split the fee think it through next time john asks who is he sherlock says softly the most dangerous man youve ever met and not my problem right now sherlock with more strength in his voice says on my desk the number
john shoots him a dark look then turns to walk toward the desk john walks to the desk activates his phone and picks up a piece of paper taken from a luggage label sherlock still has his hands together and eyes closed john looks at the name on the paper and says jennifer wilson that was hang on john looks at sherlock and asks wasnt that the dead woman sherlock says yes thats not important just enter the number shaking his head john starts punching in the number into his phone sherlock asks are you doing it with his eyes closed john replies yes sherlock immediately asks have you done it john frustrated exclaims ye hang on he shakes his head sherlock orders these words exactly what happened john starts to type as sherlock continues at lauriston gardens i must have blacked out john briefly looks across to sherlock as if concerned at what he just said sherlock continues twentytwo northumberland street please come john has gone as far as typing what happened at lauriston gdns i must have b john frowns and looks across to sherlock and asks you blacked out sherlock says what no no he starts to get up from the sofa sherlock flips his legs around and stands up walks over the coffee table and says type and send it quickly john continues typing into the phone what happened at lauriston gdns i must have blacked out going into the kitchen sherlock picks up a small pink suitcase from a chair and brings it back into the living room sherlock asks john have you sent it he walks over to the dining table john is still typing on the phone john asks whats the address sherlock lifts one of the dining chairs sherlock impatiently says twentytwo northumberland street hurry up sherlock flips the dining chair around setting it down in front of one of the two armchairs near the fireplace he puts the suitcase onto the dining chair and sits down in the armchair john finishes the message what happened at lauriston gdns i must have blacked out 22 northumberland st please come sherlock unzips the case and flips open the lid revealing the contents there are a few items of clothing and underwear all in pink a washbag and a paperback novel by paul bunch entitled come to bed eyes john turns toward the case and he staggers backward slightly in shock when he realises what hes looking at
john says thats thats the pink ladys case thats jennifer wilsons case he continues to move backward in shock sherlock confirms yes obviously he looks at the case closely john continues to stare sherlock looks up at him rolls his eyes and says sarcastically oh perhaps i should mention i didnt kill her john i never said you did sherlock looks up at john and says why not given the text i just hd you send and the fact that i have her case its a pefectly logical assumption john asks do people usually assume youre the murderer sherlock smirks and replies now and then yes he puts his hands onto the arms of the armchair and lifts his feet up and under him so that he is perching on the seat with his backside braced against the back rest john looks at sherlock warily and says okay john limps across the room and asks how did you get this sherlock clasps his hands under his chin sherlock says by looking john drops heavily into the armchair on the other side of the fireplace as he asks where sherlock explains the killer must have driven her to lauriston gardens sherlock is still perched on the backside of his chair sherlock continues he could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car john stares at the case while sherlock explains nobody can be seen with this case without sherlock drawing attention particularly a man which is statistically more likely so obviously hed feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it wouldnt have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake sherlock continues i checked every back street wide enough while john looks at sherlock then intently back at the case sherlock for a car five minutes away from lauriston gardens flashback of sherlock standing on the edge of a rooftop looking down into the streets below as he searches for a glimpse of anywhere the case might have been hidden sherlock narrates and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed flashback of sherlock back on the ground and rooting through a large skip garbage bin in the alley before finding the case buried under black plastic then checking the luggage label attached to the handle sherlock narrates took me less than an hour to find the right skip back to the present john incredulously says pink you got all that because you realised the case would be pink sherlock says well it had to be pink obviously john to himself says aloud why didnt i think of that sherlock states because youre an idiot john looks up at him startled sherlock makes a placatory gesture with his right hand and quickly adds no no no dont look like that practically everyone is sherlock refolds his hands and says to john now look john turns from looking at sherlock to looking at the case sherlock points at the case with his index fingers and asks do you see whats missing
john replies from the case how could i sherlock smiles and says her phone wheres her mobile phone there was no phone on the body theres no phone in the case we know she had one thats her number there you just texted it john suggests maybe she left it at home sherlock puts his hands down onto the arms of the chair then lowers his feet to sit down properly on the chair he explains she has a string of lovers and shes careful about it she never leaves her phone at home he puts the slip of paper back into the luggage label on the case and looks at john expectantly john says er thoughtfully he looks down at his mobile phone on the arm of his chair and asks why did i just send that text sherlock says well the question is where is her phone now john proposes she could have lost it sherlock says yes or john thinks for a moment john slowly says the murderer you think the murderer has the phone sherlock proposes maybe she left it when she left her case maybe he took it from her john nods in agreement as sherlock continues for some reason sherlock either way the balance of probability is john has a shocked look on his face as sherlock continues the murderer has her phone john interrupts and says sorry what are we doing did i just text a murderer what good will that do as if on cue johns phone begins to ring sherlock and john both look at the phone john picks up his phone and looks at the screen for the caller id which reads withheld calling john looks to sherlock as the phone continues to ring john looks at sherlock as sherlock says a few hours after his last victim and now he receives a text sherlock explains as the phone continues to ring that can only be from her if somebody had just found that phone theyd ignore a text like that but the murderer
sherlock pauses dramatically for a moment until the phone stops ringing he finishes would panic he abruptly flips the lid of the suitcase sherlock stands up and walks across the room to pick up his jacket as john continues to stare down at his phone sherlock puts on his jacket and walks toward the door john finally looks up john asks sherlock have you talked to the police sherlock turns around toward john sherlock answers four people are dead there isnt time to talk to the police he adjusts his jacket john asks so why are you talking to me sherlock reaches behind the door sherlock answers mrs hudson took my skull sherlock takes his greatcoat from the hook john looks toward the fireplace and notices that something is missing from the mantelpiece he asks so im basically filling in for your skull sherlock putting on his coat says relax youre doing fine john doesnt move sherlock asks well john apparently a little bummed out asks well what sherlock finishes putting on his coat as he says well you could just sit there and watch telly john turns toward sherlock and asks what you want me to come with you sherlock is organizing his scarf as he replies i like company when i go out and i think better when i talk aloud the skull just attracts attention so john smiles briefly sherlock is putting on his scarf when he asks problem john turns around to sherlock and says yeah sergeant donovan sherlock has finished putting on his scarf when he looks away in exasperation and asks what about her john says she said you get off on this you enjoy it sherlock smirks and nonchalantly says and i said dangerous and here you are immediately he turns and walks out of the door john sits thoughtfully for a few seconds then says damn it as he roughly leans onto his cane to push himself to his feet and head for the door
